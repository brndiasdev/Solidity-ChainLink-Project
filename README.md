# Sample Solidity Project

This project utilizes Solidity smart contracts and incorporates the SafeMath, PriceConverter, and Chainlink/OpenZeppelin libraries.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a Solidity-based smart contract that includes additional functionality provided by the SafeMath, PriceConverter, and Chainlink/OpenZeppelin libraries.

# Features

The project incorporates the following key features and libraries:

SafeMath Library: The SafeMath library is a mathematical library designed to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities in Solidity contracts. It provides secure arithmetic operations for uint256 variables, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

PriceConverter: The PriceConverter is used to facilitate the conversion of prices or values between different tokens or currencies. It includes functions to fetch the price of a token from an external data source, such as an oracle, and perform conversions based on the fetched data.

Chainlink/OpenZeppelin Libraries: The project leverages the Chainlink and OpenZeppelin libraries to enhance functionality and security. The Chainlink library enables integration with external oracles to fetch real-world data, while the OpenZeppelin library provides a collection of reusable and secure smart contract components.
